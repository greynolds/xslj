# xalan

A simple example of using clojure to implement xslt extension
functions, using xalan.

src/main/java contains an extension function implemented in java.
This is just to establish that the extension functionality is working.

src/xalan contains extension functions implemented in clojure.

test/xalan/ext_test.clj contains code to test the extension functions
using JAXP to process a simple xml file and xslt stylesheet.
